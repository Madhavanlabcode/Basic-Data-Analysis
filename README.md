# Basic-Data-Analysis

## What is this?

This is Java code initially written by Daniel Walkup for data analysis with STM data. The code has many different data analysis processes, but involves a learning curve due to the code's idiosyncracies and user interface. There are many existing bugs, so feel free to fix them or put them in the issues for this repository.

## What do I do with this code?

People in the lab have traditionally used this code with the IDE Eclipse. After cloning this project and starting Eclipse, use File->Import->Existing Projects into Workspace. After making sure that the "Copy projects into workspace" button is unchecked, navigate to the folder "Basic Data Analysis", and import the Basic Data Analysis project into Eclipse.

## How do I use this code?

Using this code has a decent learning curve, usually associated with diving into the code itself. It would be a good idea for someone to make a tutorial (e.g. TUTORIAL.md) and place it in the repository on the same level as the README.
